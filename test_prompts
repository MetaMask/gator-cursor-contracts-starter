# Test Prompts

The following prompts to see how our `.cursorrules` file is working under a few desirable use cases.

## Popup City Tickets
I want to make a contract that allows me to sell tickets to an upcoming event in a web of trust, where only invited people can buy tickets.

## Macro Recorder
we came up with an idea of a "macro recorder" using Delegator.
I can think of some similar concepts from web browsers several years ago, most of which died due to changes in Chrome and Firefox Extensions: Greasemonkey and iMacros.
Here's an example use case -- I want to record the following sequence:
1. Approve 2 wstETH on a specific trading platform
2. Trade 2 wstETH into WETH
3. Approve WETH on a specific lending platform
4. Lend WETH: Assume this is transferrable
5. Transfer the WETH debt ownership to the delegator.

This contract doesn't need a registry of macros: It trusts the solver to provide the right macro and execute it.
Assume the user was able to define a delegation that enforces the correct outcome at the end of the macro.
The solver only needs to be able to call a sequence of actions. These may result in the macro contract temporarily holding assets,
but they should be returned to the user at the end of the macro.
